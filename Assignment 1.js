// What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
// react.development.js is used when we were in development
// react.production.js is used when we have to launch our web-app in production ( minifies app )

// What is async and defer?

// Use defer when scripts are dependent on one another

// In Normal script tag -> html parsing is stopped and script is fetched and executes and after that html parsing will be continue
// the script is downloaded asynchronously with the rest of the page without pausing the HTML parsing and the contents of the page are processed and displayed. OR downloads script asynchronously (stops HTML parsing) and executes script (stops HTML parsing)

// browser not to interfere with the HTML parsing and only to execute the script file once the HTML document has been fully parsed.
// downloads script asynchronously (stops HTML parsing) and executes script (after HTML parsing)
